This is a personal repository for tinkering with the Team Fortress SDK by Valve Software. Please see source-sdk-readme.md for more information on that. I will probably turn this into something more unique and less Team Fortress-y over time, though.

Currently focusing on making custom weapon stats. Over time, will rework classes into my original characters, sneak my custom maps in, and more. The built form is currently not available to download, but the source code is here for you to look at :)
